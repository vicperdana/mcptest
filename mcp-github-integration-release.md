# SemantiClip v0.1.1: MaMCP also introduces three core concepts that make AI interactions more powerful:

### **Tools**
Standardized wrappers around external APIs that let large language models (LLMs) act like skilled assistants who understand how to use various apps on your behalf. For example, a GitHub tool can create repositories, commit files, or manage issues—all through simple, consistent commands.

### **Resources**
Think of resources as files or data that AI agents can read and understand. In SemantiClip's case, resources might include your video files, generated transcripts, or existing blog posts. MCP makes it easy for AI agents to access and work with these different types of content safely and efficiently.

### **Prompts**
These are reusable templates that help AI agents understand exactly what you want them to do. Instead of writing complex instructions every time, MCP prompts provide consistent, tested ways to communicate tasks. For publishing blog posts, a prompt might include instructions like "format this content as markdown and commit it to the specified repository with the given message."

These three concepts work together to create more intelligent and context-aware interactions, making automation both powerful and predictable.

![SemantiClip MCP Integration](../images/semanticlip-mcp-banner.png)

Creating and sharing content should be simple and accessible to everyone. With **SemantiClip v0.1.1**, we've taken a big step toward that goal by integrating the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, making it effortless for users of all technical levels to publish AI-generated blog posts directly to GitHub. This update transforms complex workflows into straightforward actions, helping you turn your video content into polished blog posts with just one click.

## What's New: Simplified GitHub Publishing with MCP

SemantiClip now lets you publish your blog posts to GitHub without needing to navigate complicated setups or commands. Here’s what you can expect:

- **One-Click Publishing**: Easily send your content to any GitHub repository you have access to.
- **Smart Automation**: MCP handles the publishing steps behind the scenes, so you don’t have to.
- **Custom Commit Messages**: Add personalized notes to your GitHub commits.
- **Live Progress Updates**: See exactly what’s happening as your content gets published.
- **Secure Access**: Uses GitHub tokens to keep your data safe during publishing.

This means even if you're not a developer, you can confidently publish your content with minimal effort.

## What Is Model Context Protocol?

Think of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as a universal translator for AI agents. Just like how a translator helps people speaking different languages understand each other, MCP allows AI agents to communicate smoothly with various platforms and services—like GitHub—without confusion.

In everyday terms, MCP acts like a trusted assistant that knows exactly how to talk to different systems, making sure your AI-generated content gets where it needs to go, in the right format, and securely. This standardization removes the guesswork and technical barriers, enabling seamless integration across tools and services.

MCP also introduces the concept of “tools,” which are standardized wrappers around external APIs. These tools let large language models (LLMs) act like skilled assistants who understand how to use various apps on your behalf, enabling more intelligent and context-aware interactions.

## Why Model Context Protocol Matters

MCP standardizes how AI agents interact with external systems, creating a common language that simplifies complex integrations. Instead of each AI needing to learn a new way to communicate with every platform, MCP provides a consistent protocol that everyone can use.

Imagine MCP as a universal adapter for AI: no matter what device (or platform) you have, MCP ensures the connection works perfectly. This means faster development, improved security, and greater flexibility. For users, it translates to smoother experiences and more reliable automation.

## How MCP Works Behind the Scenes

At its core, each MCP tool has a clear structure that enables smooth communication and execution:

- **Name**: The identifier for the tool.
- **Description**: A brief explanation of what the tool does.
- **Parameter Schema**: Defines the inputs the tool accepts, ensuring proper usage.
- **Handler Function**: The code that executes the tool’s operation when called.

This structure allows AI agents to discover, understand, and invoke tools reliably, making integrations consistent and extensible.

## How It Works: Bringing It All Together

Here’s how SemantiClip uses MCP to make publishing effortless:

1. **Preparing Your Content**: Your AI-generated blog post is polished and ready.
2. **Connecting Securely**: MCP establishes a safe link to your GitHub account.
3. **Coordinating the Process**: Intelligent agents handle the publishing workflow automatically.
4. **Managing GitHub Tasks**: MCP takes care of uploading files and making commits.
5. **Publishing with Confidence**: Your blog post is live on GitHub with your custom message.

Behind the scenes, this means you don’t need to worry about APIs, commands, or manual uploads—the system handles it all.

```csharp
// Example of the MCP integration in action
var mcpClient = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(new StdioClientTransport(
    new StdioClientTransportOptions
    {
        Name = "GitHub",
        Command = "npx",
        Arguments = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        EnvironmentVariables = new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            { "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN", gitHubToken }
        }
    }));
```

## Enhanced User Experience

- **Scalability**: Designed to handle multiple publishing tasks asynchronously, so performance stays strong.
- **Protocol Flexibility**: MCP clients can communicate over multiple protocols such as Streamable HTTP and Server-Sent Events (SSE), enhancing compatibility with diverse environments.

```csharp
public class PublishBlogPostStep : KernelProcessStep<BlogPublishingResponse>
{
    private async Task<IMcpClient> GetMcpClientAsync()
    {
        var mcpClient = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(
            new StdioClientTransport(new StdioClientTransportOptions
            {
                Name = "GitHub",
                Command = "npx",
                Arguments = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
                EnvironmentVariables = new Dictionary<string, string>
                {
                    { "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN", MCPConfig.GitHubPersonalAccessToken }
                }
            }));
        return mcpClient;
    }
}
```

```csharp
private ChatCompletionAgent CreateAgentWithPlugin(
    Kernel kernel,
    KernelPlugin plugin,
    string? instructions,
    string? name,
    IList<McpClientTool>? mcpTools)
{
    if (mcpTools?.Any() == true)
    {
        kernel.Plugins.AddFromFunctions("GitHub", 
            mcpTools.Select(tool => tool.AsKernelFunction()));
    }
    
    return new ChatCompletionAgent
    {
        Instructions = instructions,
        Name = name,
        Kernel = kernel,
        Arguments = new KernelArguments(new PromptExecutionSettings
        {
            FunctionChoiceBehavior = FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto()
        })
    };
}
```

    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Blog post successfully published");
        return Ok(result);
    }
    else
    {
        _logger.LogWarning("Failed to publish blog post: {Message}", result.Message);
        return BadRequest(result);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    var errorMessage = $"Error publishing blog post: {ex.Message}";
    _logger.LogError(ex, errorMessage);
    return StatusCode(500, new BlogPublishingResponse 
    { 
        Success = false, 
        Message = errorMessage 
    });
}
```

### Early-stage Architecture

SemantiClip's MCP integration is still in its early, proof-of-concept stage. While not yet designed for high-scale production workloads, we've started with some solid architectural basics: asynchronous workflows for responsiveness and proper resource cleanup to avoid memory leaks.
